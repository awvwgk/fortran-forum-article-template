# Organization of Standards Committees

## ISO, SC22 and WG5

The production and maintenance of International Standards in the field
of Information Technology is carried out by the International Organization
for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission
(IEC) through their Joint Technical Committee 1 (JTC1). Most of the
work of JTC1 is, however, delegated to one of 20 Sub-Committees (SCs)
which, in turn, normally delegate the detailed work to permanent Working
Groups (WGs).

SC22 is the JTC1 Sub-Committee responsible for *programming languages,
their environments and system software interfaces*, and carries out
most of its work through its Working Groups. WG5 is the Working Group
responsible for the development and maintenance of Fortran language
standards.

WG5, like all other JTC1 Working Groups, consists of a Convenor and
one or more Project Editors, all appointed by the parent Sub-Committee
(SC22 in WG5's case), together with a number of individual members
who are nominated by their National Member Bodies. It is not possible
to apply directly to become an individual member of a Working Group
without the support of an appropriate Member Body.

WG5 currently operates a two-tier development structure whereby the
Working Group itself determines the broad technical content of the
Standards and other formal documents that it is working on, but delegates
much of the detailed work to *development bodies* who are charged
with assisting the Project Editor for a particular project to create
the actual text for the document. For the Fortran 95, Fortran 2003,
Fortran 2008 and Fortran 2018 Standards, the US Fortran Committee
(INCITS/PL22.3) was given the role of Primary Development Body. All
WG5 working documents are available on the WG5 Electronic Document
Archive.

## Officers

* WG5 Convenor: Steve Lionel (US)
* ISO/IEC 1539 Project Manager (formerly called Project Editor): Malcolm Cohen (UK)
* Corrigenda Editor: David Muxworthy (UK)

John Reid (UK) was WG5 Convenor from 1999 through 2017. From 1995
until 1999, the Convenor of WG5 was Miles Ellis (UK). His predecessor
was Jeanne Martin (USA), who was Convenor from 1982 until 1994. Prior
to that Jeanne Adams (USA) was Convenor of WG5 and its predecessor,
the Fortran Experts Group, from the creation of the latter in 1978
until 1982.

The editor of the Fortran 2003 Standard (ISO/IEC 1539-1:2004(E)) was
Richard Maine (USA).

The editor of the Fortran 95 Standard (ISO/IEC 1539-1:1997) was Richard
Maine (USA).

The editor of the Fortran 90 Standard (IS 1539:1991) was Lloyd Campbell
(USA) during most of its development and Mike Metcalf (CERN) during
the final stages.


## Documents

Documents are available at

```
https://wg5-fortran.org/documents.html
```

This is an index of all WG5 documents, with links to those that are
available in electronic form. They are in reverse order so that the
most recent appear first. Electronic versions exists for most documents from 1995 to the current day. N003 is the earliest, and is dated 1978.

Where not otherwise indicated, papers were originated by the Convenor:
up to N1074, Jeanne Martin; N1075 to N1374, Miles Ellis.

N001 to N099 were left free for pre-1985 documents and N100 to N199
for 1985-1986 but they were never allocated in detail.

## Fortran 202x

Fortran 202x is the working title of the revision of the Fortran standard
after Fortran 2018. Previously it was referred to as Fortran 2020.
Fortran 2018 is the current standard.

This is the current development schedule (see N2135) for Fortran 202x.
See the Glossary for definitions of terms.

* Started planning further revision 2017-06
* Choose issues that need attention 2018-06
* Preliminary choice of technical content 2019-08
* Final choice of technical content 2020-10
* CD constructed 2021-06
* CD ballot initiated 2021-07

## PL22.3 - Programming Language Fortran

PL22.3 - Programming Language Fortran, (formerly J3) is the US Fortran
standards committee, a technical subcommittee of the International
Committee for Information Technology Standards (INCITS) formerly known
as the National Committee for Information Technology Standards (NCITS).
The INCITS address is

```

PL22 is the committee for Programming Languages. Their address is

is the Fortran committee. Current participants, taken from the PL22.3
site include

J3 developed the Fortran 66, Fortran 77, Fortran 90, Fortran 95, Fortran
2003, Fortran 2008 and Fortran 2018 standards. Working closely with ISO/IEC/JTC1/SC22/WG5
(see "WG5"), the international Fortran standards committee, J3 is
the primary development body for Fortran. Fortran 2018 was published
in 2018.

J3 is currently working under WG5 direction to produce a new revision
of the Fortran standard, tentatively called Fortran 202x. This will
be a minor revision of Fortran 2018. The work plan and schedule are
available.

J3 meetings, documents, and membership are open to anyone worldwide.
Meeting information and documents are available from this website;
membership information may be obtained from any committee member.
Any interested party can submit a paper for consideration at a J3
meeting by following the J3 committee guidelines.
